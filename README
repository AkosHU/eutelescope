This is a first trial to integrate LCIO + Marlin into the standard
analysis procedure used within the sucimaPix framework. Of course this
is under very heavy develop, so please check very often for updates
and new releases.

To install it, download the source code via cvs or a tarball with the
source code from the web CVS interface. The code has been organized as
a Marlin package, so copy the Eutelescope folder into the
$(MARLIN)/packages folder and type make from Marlin top level
directory. So far, there is no need to add user specific includes and
libraries, so the userlib.gmk in Marlin top level folder is actually
an empty file.

The documentation is built together with the Marlin one typing make
doc from the top level directory. All Eutelescope classes belongs to
eutelescope namespace.
